Static stretching means a stretch is held in a challenging but comfortable position for a period of time, usually somewhere between 10 to 30 seconds. Static stretching is the most common form of stretching found in general fitness and is considered safe and effective for improving overall flexibility. Flexibility is one of the five components of fitness, so stretching should be an integral part of every workout program. Flexibility is primarily due to one‚Äôs genetics, gender, age, body shape and level of physical activity. As people grow older, they tend to lose flexibility, usually as a result of inactivity, but partially because of the aging process itself. The less active you are, the less flexible you are likely to be. As with cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength, flexibility will improve with regular training. The benefits of static stretching include: \n\n1. Allows greater freedom of movement and improved posture\n2. Increases physical and mental relaxation\n3. Releases muscle tension and soreness\n4.

Tabata is a workout that lasts four minutes only for one set, but it's likely to be one of the longest four minutes you've ever endured. The structure of the program is as follows:\n* Work out hard for 20 seconds\n* Rest for 10 seconds\n* Complete 8 rounds\nYou push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise.¬†You can do pretty much any exercise you wish. You can do squats, push-ups, burpees or any other exercise that works your large muscle groups. Kettlebell exercises work great, too.\n\nHowever we have kept 8 different exercises on each round to keep the workout more interesting and fun. Our Tabata routine looks like this:\n1. Squats Lateral Walk\n2. Floor Pushups (If you cant do the full push-ups, you can do by kneeling down as shown by Rosetta in the video)\n3. Crab Toe Touch\n4. Reverse Plank\n5. Lateral Running Floor Touches\n6. Curtsy Lunges\n7. Pogo Squats\n8. Dead Bug\n\nThe pace in the video is shown for the beginners but you think it is easy for you then you can increase the pace. The goal is to keep the heartbeat pumping as high as possible. So follow the same routine with your desired pace. We bet it will challenge all of you guys as it definitely did challenge us.\n\nIf you are still reading this, thank you very much. It would be a great help if you could like, share and subscribe the video as the algorithm of youtube likes it. And of course don‚Äôt forget to hit the bell icon, it really helps to push more contents to you. Till then stay safe and stay fit.

Cardi B |", "description": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has become a popular way to burn fat in the gym, but that's not all this type of cardio training is good for.\n\nThe essential framework of high-intensity interval training is always the same: Brief, all-out work periods, separated by rest periods that you wish were just a little longer. The work-to-rest ratio can vary from 1:1 (for example, 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off) to 1:4 or more, and the rounds can be just a few or 15 or more. But no matter how long you rest, the key is that you bring everything you've got to your intervals.\n\nHIIT can be used to lose as much fat as possible while cutting, to stay lean and conditioned while adding muscle, or to improve aerobic and anaerobic endurance for performance-focused athletes.\n\nThese exercises can be done at home itself and the intensity depends on the level of stamina each has. So do at your own pace but try challenge yourself by increasing the intensity. \n\nInstagram-@theFitologists\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/thefitologists/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel\n\n\nSpecial Thanks To:\n\nFitstop Fitness, Lalitpur, Nepal\n\nAkbar Shah,Level 3, Labim Mall, Lalitpur, Nepal\n\nHIIT Music\n\nBodybuilding Store, Kathmandu, Nepal\n\n#TheFitologists", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gi_IIpAJ34/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gi_IIpAJ34/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gi_IIpAJ34/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gi_IIpAJ34/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3gi_IIpAJ34/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "The Fitologists", "playlistId": "PLokrVG9vlU5VbeIbv3rv9r3jwIxNA0H8f", "position": 5, "resourceId": {"kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "3gi_IIpAJ34"}, "videoOwnerChannelTitle": "The Fitologists", "videoOwnerChannelId": "UCHz0ZLQTzHjmxJ-ZS7fUM_Q"}, "contentDetails": {"videoId": "3gi_IIpAJ34", "videoPublishedAt": "2018-04-01T15:28:24Z"}}, {"kind": "youtube#playlistItem", "etag": "fYdo4HEWdAmTQ8v8p6WDaoVtDaA", "id": "UExva3JWRzl2bFU1VmJlSWJ2M3J2OXIzandJeE5BMEg4Zi41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2018-08-07T11:36:45Z", "channelId": "UCHz0ZLQTzHjmxJ-ZS7fUM_Q", "title": "Upper-Body Workout For Beginners | Road To Fitness | Motivation", "description": "Hello Guys, The Fitologists are back with a Training video and again focusing on the beginners.

Tabata is a workout that lasts four minutes only for one set, but it's likely to be one of the longest four minutes you've ever endured. The structure of the program is as follows:\n* Work out hard for 20 seconds\n* Rest for 10 seconds\n* Complete 8 rounds\nYou push yourself as hard as you can for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set. You'll complete eight sets of each exercise.¬†You can do pretty much any exercise you wish. You can do squats, push-ups, burpees or any other exercise that works your large muscle groups. Kettlebell exercises work great, too.\n\nHowever we have kept 8 different exercises on each round to keep the workout more interesting and fun. Our Tabata routine looks like this:\n1. Jumping Jacks\n2. Glute Bridge\n3. Mountain Climber\n4. Shuffle\n5. Walk Out\n6. Reverse Lunges\n7. Abs Cruches\n8. Plank Jack\n\nThe pace in the video is shown for the beginners but you think it is easy for you then you can increase the pace. The goal is to keep the heartbeat pumping as high as possible. So follow the same routine with your desired pace. This exercise and the intensity is for those who have just gotten into fitness. Try your best as our fit moms did in the video.\n\nIf you are still reading this, thank you very much. It would be a great help if you could like, share and subscribe the video as the algorithm of youtube likes it.
